# IP Checker

## About The Project

This is a simple ip checker program which emails and send a discord message whenever the device IP is changed. Since I currently do not have a static ip, I use to send myself reminder whenever my device ip is changed due to unknown reasons (eg, blackout, unnotified ISP maintainence).

##### Example Gmail set up

1. Gmail Access
In order to allow gmail to be accessed and send email, within Google Account, you will need to turn on "Less Secure app access". This might not seems the most secure thing to do, but in order to allow application like this to access the mail, it is something you need to do.
[Learn more about Less Secure App & your Google Account here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)

[Turn on here](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)

If you have got 2 Factor Authenication set up, and you do not want to disable it, you will need to create an application specific password. 

[Generate Application Specific Password](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords)

2. bare minimum `mail.json` set up

```
{
    "service": "gmail",
    "auth": {
      "user": "example@examplegmail.com",
      "pass": "Password" 
    },
}
```

### Usage

Run it through pm2 is prefered since it can set as a start up script, but can also run as normal node instance

if inside the directory, 
```
pm2 start index.js
pm2 save
```

or 

if outside the folder,

```
pm2 start ip-checker
pm2 save
```

Running with just node inside the directory

```
node .
```

Running outside the directory

```
node ip-checker
```
